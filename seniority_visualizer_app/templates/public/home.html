                This is a project that aims to revive what was lost when the company's implementation of a seniority
                estimator
                was lost several years ago. It can't, nor will it attempt, to provide advice about a pilot's career
                decisions.
                However, it can give some insight as to how we are doing as a pilot group, and what your place in it
                could
                look at any arbitrary point in time.

                The information provided here is calculated under the assumption that each pilot will remain active on
                the seniority list until reaching their retirement date (age 65 rule).
